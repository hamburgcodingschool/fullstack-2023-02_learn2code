## Exercise 1
### Beachwalk Hotel üèñ <br />
Let's calculate how much a hotel stay costs at the fantastic Beachwalk Hotel

### 1.1
The price for night is `90‚Ç¨`<br />
Ask the user for how many nights he would like to stay and print the total cost.

### 1.2
Breakfast is an extra `10‚Ç¨`<br />
Continue from the last exercise and ask the user if he would like to include breakfast.<br />
Print the total cost.

#### Hint
1. The decision should end up in a boolean variable, such that you can use it in an if statement.
1. (this is new information!) You could use a comparison operator called `==` which also works for strings.
2. For example `let answer = "yes"; answer=="yes"`
3. (lazy approach) you can also use a readline-sync method called `keyInYN`

### 1.3
Discount<br />
Let's discount guests who stay for longer periods.<br />
Continue from the last exercise and calculate a discount.<br />
> 5 nights or more, 10%<br />
> 10 nights or more, 15%<br />
> 15 nights or more, 20%<br />
```
Only the room is affected by the discount. Breakfast price stays the same.
```

2. Tenqhnyyl hcqngr gur `qvfpbhag_creprag` jvgu qvssrerag vs fgngrzragf.

### 1.4
Extra guest <br />
Continue from the last exercise.<br />
Ask the user how many guests will stay in the room (1 or 2)<br />
> Add 10‚Ç¨ per night for an extra guest (Before discount)
```
Don't forget the extra breakfast ü•ê
```


## Exercise 2
### Currency converter V2
Take the program from today, that asks the user for an amount in USD and prints out the value in EURO.<br />
Use the rate 1 USD = 0.910463 EUR. Extend the converter to use a precision of 2 decimal points in the output.<br />
For example the output for 100 USD should be 94.04 EUR (the bank will cut the extra 0.0063 EUR and make profit from that).
